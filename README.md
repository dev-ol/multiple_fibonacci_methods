# multiple_fibonacci_methods

To compile each method of the Fibonacci cpp file you can run :

- g++ recursion.cpp -o recursion; g++ memoized_dp.cpp -o memoized_dp; g++ iteration.cpp -o iteration; g++ formula.cpp -o formula

To execute, run : ./memoized_dp; ./iteration; ./formula; ./recursion;

The results will be printed to a text file under the results folder.

Then to create the graphy, simply run "python3 graphy.py". Note that you will need to install the python package "matplotlib". The graphs will be in the graphs folder.
